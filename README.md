# github-workflows

Shared, parameterized reusable GitHub Actions workflows for repos owned by
the `branchLeft` org. One workflow lives here per reusable capability; each
target repo keeps a thin caller workflow that just points at the pinned
version here.

## Why a separate repo

Keeping the actual logic in one place means a fix or improvement lands once
and every caller repo picks it up by bumping a tag, instead of copy-pasted
YAML drifting out of sync across `shared-infra`, `ghost-platform`,
`ghost-platform-docs`, `website`, `components`, and whatever comes next.

## Versioning

Callers should reference an exact tag (`@v1.0.6`), not `@main` — `main` is
the dev branch here and can change without warning. Tags are immutable
org-wide (a ruleset blocks moving or deleting them), so there's no
moving-`@v1`-forward convention — every change, including fixes, ships as a
new patch/minor tag:

```bash
git tag -s v1.0.3 -m "v1.0.3: <what changed>" <commit>
git push origin v1.0.3
```

The tag ruleset requires signatures, so `-s` rather than `-a`.

Bumping every caller means a one-line PR per repo (`@v1.0.5` → `@v1.0.6` in
each caller workflow) rather than a single silent update — more PR noise, but
every caller's history shows exactly which version it's on and when it
changed.

A workflow here must never hardcode a tag of this repo internally. Tags are
immutable, so a literal ref inside a workflow pins callers to a revision that
has no relationship to the one they asked for — `docs-lint.yml` uses
`github.job_workflow_sha` to load its own rules from the exact commit the
caller resolved.

## Workflows

### `docs-lint.yml`

Enforces the mechanical parts of the org documentation standard over markdown
and code comments. Rules, suppression syntax and rationale:
[`tools/docs-lint-rules.md`](tools/docs-lint-rules.md).

**Caller usage** — add to the target repo as
`.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml`:

```yaml
name: docs-lint

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  docs-lint:
    uses: branchLeft/github-workflows/.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml@v1.0.6
```

No secrets, no write permission, no per-repo allow-list change — the job is
`actions/checkout` plus shell.

**Per-repo configuration** is by file, not by workflow input, so the same
caller block works everywhere:

- `.docs-lint.mode` — absent means enforce. A repo whose existing docs are not
  clean yet commits one containing `warn`, which makes the full-tree scan
  advisory while still failing on files the branch touched. Deleting the file
  is the flip to enforce.
- `.docs-lintignore` — tab-separated `glob`, rule ids, reason. Use it for
  files that legitimately match a rule, such as a document about the rules.

Adopting the gate in a repo that has never run it is therefore a two-file
change, and the ratchet means the first PR is green.
